				<h1>About Major Productions</h1>
				<p>
					Major Productions was founded and created by Kevin Major in 2010.  Kevin is a self-taught developer, having taught himself 
					PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, ASP.NET, C#, and several frameworks that use those technologies (jQuery, Kohana).  He has worked both 
					as a freelancer and for a small startup, creating sites and PHP modules for local business owners.  Kevin prides himself for 
					his attention to detail, tenacity, and getting it right the first time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kevin is also an avid gamer, and is currently developing a site dedicated to increase the awareness, and share the perspective, of 
					a physically disabled gamer - himself.  Handigamer.com, and its sister site Snoozereviewz.com, will launch later this year.
